                <p>I'm a MIMS '25 student during day, and a doggo mom of 2 and dog boarder at evening.
                In my previous life, I am a public health career person, and now I'm making a career change to Product Management!
                My previous experiences has job titles such as Barista, Sales Associate, Peer-Counselor for Post-Abortion, Clinical Researcher, and Student.
                There are figures that are a precendence to my life, such as my biggest support systems, my dogs.
                Two of my dogs are named Coconut and Moon. They are my entire world and I think about them about <em>at least</em> 10 times a day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being challenged in a new environment at MIMS is thrilling with a combined internal pressure to fight against imposter syndrome.  It's a good time to be alive and learning new things!
                Aside from myself, I'd like to use this website to showcase my doggos in a list.
                Coconut is a 3-year-old Jindo mix, from Jeju Island Korea, and Moon is a 1.5 year-old Formosan Mountain Dog Mix from Taiwan. Also an island!
                Coconut was found as a puppy, born when Jeju Island was covered in snow, and Moon was found in a very hot, almost tropical like environment.
                As such, Coconut's personality is gentle, sweet, and calm, and Moon is a powerhouse of love, energy, and determination.
                Coconut is an avid napper, loves to play outdoors. Moon is a very active dog who doesn't rest until her job is done (such as running around the house to give everyone kisses 100x).
